                    <p>Hi! My name is Qadir Ali I am a computer science graduate who who wants to increase his knowledge on different programming languages.
                        Aside from coding, I love playing basketball and video games! I spend a lot of time at the park practicing my moves and if not my headphones are on and I’m in a virtual world.  
                        I also like to spend my time helping out at the local mosque, whether that’s fund-raising or collecting food for the poor. 
                        I also have a small 100% electric last mile delivery business, I believe that electric technology is the way forward for the climate and transport going forward.</p>

                    <h3>Why FAC? content</h3>
                    <p>I came across FAC when a sibling of mine joined and graduated in FAC.., after hearing overwhelming praise for the course and the support she received from transitioning with no coding experience to a fully fledged developed is what drove me to apply.
                        FAC’s focus on peer-led learning and community is what stands out to me the most. I feel that I can learn a lot from the course because I truly believe I will be helped and pushed on things that I would enjoy codinga.
                        Also the fact that once I have completed I will also give back to the next cohort brings me a lot of personal satisfaction. I feel like giving back has become a less common thing these day.</p>
